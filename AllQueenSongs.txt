Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell

''Jenny will you stay, tarry with me, pray
Nothing e'er need come between us
Tell me, love, what do you say?''
''Oh no, I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover
How I spent my holiday''
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell

Oh, Rock of Ages
Do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh, Lady Moon, shine down
A little people magic if you will

Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama oooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo figaro (Magnifico)
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows....
